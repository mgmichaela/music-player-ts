# Waves - The Groovy Music Player 🎶

This project is a remix of an [old code base](https://github.com/mgmichaela/music-player), originally put together with good ol’ JavaScript, SASS, and useRef that I tried to learn. But hey, time flies, and I figured it was time to give it a fresh coat of paint and some TypeScript love.

## Why Did I Refactor This? 🤔

A few years back, I built this music player using React, SASS, and useRef to handle some of the trickier bits. It worked, but I knew it could be better. So, I rolled up my sleeves and refactored it using TypeScript. This project was a perfect excuse to level up my TypeScript game. Plus, it’s always fun to revisit old projects.

### What’s New?

- **TypeScript:** Because type safety is the new black.
- **Cleaner, better code:** I took the old code, refactored it, and made it more maintainable and scalable.
- **[Deployed](https://waves-music-player-ts.netlify.app/) via Netlify.**

### What Could Be Improved? 🛠️

Of course, no project is ever truly finished. If I had more time (or another late-night coding session), I’d probably:

- Add volume control, so you can actually turn it up (or down).
- Make it a bit more responsive, so it looks fab on every screen size.
